## How Did COVID-19 Impact Citi Bike Ridership?

Citi Bike is the largest bike sharing system in the US and services Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens in New York City as well as Jersey City, New Jersey. Not only do they provide a healthy and affordable way to get around the city, they've also been collecting the data since they started in 2013 and saving it in monthly files to be explored. This was the task at hand; explore this data with any timeline and find two phenomena--something unexpected or surprising.

### Discovery and Analysis

When I first started to download a couple files, the thought was to get the initial file from 2013 and compare those results from the latest file from October 2020. A lot must have changed including ridership and number of stations. But after some thought, I realized that maybe the 2013 data wasn't really all that relevant to today. With COVID-19 being such a part of everyday life, it dawned on me that we're looking at data from NYC which was the main hotspot for COVID last spring. The Citi Bike sharing system must've felt the effects of that with all the lockdowns and closures and it would be reflected in the data. Since a lot of businesses and industries are still either working from home or just closed like the theater district, I expected ridership to be down as well. So I started looking into that data, comparing October 2019 to October 2020 (the most recent file). Much to my great surprise, ridership was actually higher in October of this year than last year.

## Phenomenon #1 - Citi Bike Has Increesed Its Ridership Amidst the Pandemic

I downloaded the CSV files for both October 2019 and October 2020 and loaded them into *Tableau* creating a union to merge the two datasets. Had to do some column renaming and dataype changes but for the most part the data source was in pretty good shape. I started with the October Totals page. I wanted to show the total ridership this year versus last year and show how much of an increase was gained, especially since that's what surprised me. 

Next I wanted to see who these riders were -- were they Customers buying a short-term pass or Subscribers purchasing annual memberships. Both types ended up showing increases. The Customers did have a bigger growth, however, just about double their 2019 numbers. Did those short-term passes lead to more trips? Did that change where they got the bike and where they road it to? This also led to my second surprise, or rather more of an interesting finding -- female riders showed an increase in both user types. Riders who didn't specify their gender did have a significant growth in Customer rides but only minor growth in annual membership purchases. Male rider numbers actually decreased for Subscribers. But female riders showed measurable growth in both. I wasn't expecting such a difference between the three groups. With male ridership overall signficantly higher than female ridership and the closures and shutdowns impacting both males and females, I expected them both to show increases or decreases, not one have increases and the other mixed. So I knew that was my second topic to look into.

### Data ETL

With these questions in mind and my second phenomenon already swirling in my mind, I knew I was going to need more data, preferably data that would show change over time, covering a few months leading up to the pandemic and then through it up to the present. *Tableau Public* also has a limit on number of rows that can be imported which I would surpass if I loaded in all the data files between October 2019 and October 2020. So I decided to import all the files into a *PostGreSQL* database, clean the data and aggregate the data there, and then export the results in a CSV file that I could then load into *Tableau* as a new data source connection. Left the original datasource in there as well as not to disrupt the worksheets already created with it. This worked pretty well for the most past. Started with 17 million+ rows of data and ended up with a little over 100,000 rows. I didn't load in November 2019, December 2019 and January 2020 at first because I wasn't sure they would be needed. But as my second phenomenon took shape, I knew that data needed to be imported as well. So that was done. Had a few hiccups with updating the data source in *Tableau* since I added a *trip_duration* column when I added the extra 3 months, but that was resolved relatively quickly.

With all the new data loaded, I started using the new data source connection in *Tableau* for the rest of my visualizations. With the analysis of who the riders are done, I wanted to find out if the stations they were using had changed in popularity. To do that, I compared the top 25 stations by number of rides for October 2020 with the numbers for those same stations in October 2019. I found that the popularity had definitely changed; some stations became much more popular whereas other stations showed a significant drop in rides starting or ending at them. I also wanted to see if that was a common outcome between an origin station comparison between years and a destination comparison. Both showed similar behavior. I was also curious about how the type of user played into that so I included the split between Customes and Subscribers. In many instances, there wasn't much change between the years. But there were several stations in the top 25 that had a significant decrease in Subscribers between October 2019 and October 2020. Station 519 is one that really stood out.

Knowing which stations of the top 25 had changes, I really needed to see all the stations and number of rides layed out on a map so I could see where these stations were and what was around them. I included the option to select more than one month so it could be seen how the numbers, or in this case dots, appeared, got bigger or stayed about the same. From the results it appears that either more stations were added farther outside the main city/Manhattan area or else more people just started taking advantage of the stations that were already close by but had not been utilized. When I first started analyzing this data, I thought ridership would be down with the city-wide restrictions but as I delved more into the data, I realized that bike riding is the perfect social distance mode of transportation--usually done singularly and outdoors. Maybe seen as a better option than enclosed in a cab?
